# MacSetup

A Collection of a couple of scripts I use to setup a factory fresh Mac with some of the settings and software I use.
```shell
cd ~/Downloads

curl -sL https://github.com/jameskilbynet/MacSetup/raw/master/defaults.sh | bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jameskilbynet/MacSetup/master/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
